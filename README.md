This app uses [Qvitter](https://git.gnu.io/h2p/Qvitter) plugin.

Before install this app you must have:

- A subdomain as ```social.example.com``` or ```gs.example.com```. Qvitter plugin won't work with paths such as ```example.com/gs```
- Created certificates from ```Let's encrypt``` or any non self-signed certificates

- Public:  Registration for everybody is enabled.
- Community: Ideal for a smalls groups. No open registration available.
- Private: Nobody outside could see the node.

Be patient. So far this installation doesn't do the following:

- Single Sign On
