# gnusocial_ynh

This app uses Qvitter plugin.

Before install this app you must have:

- A subdomain as '''social.example.com''' or '''gs.example.com'''. Qvitter plugin won't work with paths such as '''example.com/gs'''
- Created certificates from '''Let's encrypt''' or any non self-signed certificates

Be patient. So far this installation doesn't do the following:

    - LDAP logins
    - Single Sign On
